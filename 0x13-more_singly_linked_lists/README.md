# Singly Linked Lists in C

This project is a collection of functions and examples related to singly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Introduction

A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. This project provides a set of functions to perform various operations on singly linked lists, such as inserting a node, deleting a node, searching for a value, and printing the list.
